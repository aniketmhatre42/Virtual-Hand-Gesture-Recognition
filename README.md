# Virtual Hand Gesture Recognition

This project implements a Virtual Hand Gesture Recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python. The application captures real-time video from your camera and detects hand gestures, which can be used to interact with a computer, such as controlling the mouse, volume, or other functionalities.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Recognition of various hand gestures
- Integration with PyAutoGUI for controlling the computer
- Customizable gesture-to-action mappings
